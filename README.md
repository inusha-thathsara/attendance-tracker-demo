# Attendance Tracker

A powerful, cross-platform Flutter application designed to help university students manage their timetables, track attendance, and stay organized with AI-powered automation.

## 🚀 Features

### 📅 Smart Timetable Management
*   **Multiple Timetables**: Manage schedules for different semesters or exam periods.
*   **Flexible Entries**: Support for Lectures, Tutorials, and Labs with custom locations and modes (Online/In-person).
*   **Cascading Delete**: Deleting a module automatically cleans up all associated classes to keep your schedule clutter-free.
*   **Calendar View**: Switch between a weekly list and a monthly calendar view to visualize your schedule.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Automation
*   **PDF Import**: Upload your official university timetable PDF and let **Google Gemini AI** automatically extract and set up your schedule in seconds.
*   **Smart Parsing**: Intelligently identifies subject names, times, and class types.

### 🔔 Intelligent Notifications
*   **Timezone Aware**: Notifications are scheduled based on your **local device time**, ensuring you get alerts even if you travel.
*   **Pre-Class Alerts**: Get notified 10 minutes before every class so you're never late.

### ✅ Attendance Tracking
*   **Status Options**: Mark classes as **Present**, **Absent**, or **Cancelled**.
*   **Conflict Detection**: Automatically detects and warns about overlapping classes when adding or editing entries.
*   **Restricted Marking**: Prevents marking attendance for dates outside the current timetable's duration.
*   **Visual Stats**: View attendance percentages for each module to ensure you meet university requirements.
*   **Safe to Skip Calculator**: Set your target percentage (e.g., 80%) and instantly see how many classes you can safely miss or need to attend.
*   **Smart History**: View detailed attendance logs, automatically filtered to show only relevant dates for the current semester.

### 🎨 User Experience
*   **Accordion Modules**: Organize your modules by semester with a buttery-smooth, animated accordion view.
*   **Dark/Light Mode**: Fully supported themes that adapt to your system settings or manual preference.
